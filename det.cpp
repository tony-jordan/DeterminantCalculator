			// So, a working theory that we had was that, the threads did not have enought time

			// and we were given the wrong answer, I (Tony Jordan speaking) toiled on this for WEEKS
			// trying all sorts of different stuff, I tried incrementing a thread variable and printing
			// out every value, which seemed to work, but it looked really bad. Then I tried coming 
			// up with a proportion, that printed out variables based on how long (I thought) each
			// calculation needed to finish. I enlisted Tyler to help me with this issue, after I had ripped
			// my hair out because of it, and at first he didn't have too much success either. We
			// tried pausing the main thread, but that didn't work because it paused processes that really didn't
			// need to sleep. This is actually why the log base 10 and diagonal determinant calculator 
			// functions are separate, because I tried making a big thread with the threadpool contained within it
			// and joining that thread, so that the main would wait to continue until the big thread was done
			// but that broke EVERYTHING, eventually we went back to what I did at first, printing out
			// every thread number, just so we could actually get the answer right, but then, the mad
			// lad Tyler decided to just print out a space, and then and endline. And then all of the sudden
			// it worked, and not only did it work it was FAST. And after that, he just made it 
			// an endline. which worked EVEN FaStEr!
			// At the time, this made absolutely NO sense at all, but after doing some testing and 
			// critical thinking, the theory is that when the thread completed its task, it was left to
			// its own devices which is REALLY bad when using threads. So when it prints a newline character,
			// The thread is occupied until it is called again. (Althought that shouldn't be the
			// case because I'm only using the threadpool to push the triangular method, so it
			// shouldn't interact with the cout, but it works very well so I'm not complaining.)
